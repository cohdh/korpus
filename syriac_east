And a joyful mother of children.
Beg of the Lord and pray before him.
Kings of the earth and all peoples.
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost.
From everlasting to everlasting.
Let all the people say Amen and Amen.

Tuesday Morning.

Praise the Lord O ye righteous.;                                                                                                             1
For it becometh well the upright to give praise.;                                                                                            2
They went from one nation to another.;                                                                                                       4
The Lord will abide in it for ever.;                                                                                                         3
Happy are the people that are in such a case.;                                                                                               3
Unto the godly hath shone forth light in the darkness.;                                                                                      3
More to be desired are they than gold and than precious stones.;                                                                             4
Shall they that are in the graves show thy lovingkindness.;                                                                                  3
As a city surrounded with a wall.;                                                                                                           4
I was strengthened and could not attain unto it.;                                                                                            5
For thy sake have we been killed daily.;                                                                                                     3
For there the Lord promised a blessing and life for evermore.;                                                                               4
O come let us kneel and worship him.;                                                                                                        4
They that go down to the sea in ships.;                                                                                                      3
Out of the deep have I called unto thee.;                                                                                                    4
I will always bless the Lord.;                                                                                                               3
How good and beautiful.;                                                                                                                     5
As thirsty and tired land that desireth water.;                                                                                              4
They are new (gods) which now have been made.;                                                                                               5
And I spake of peace.;                                                                                                                       3
Confess him and bless his Name.;                                                                                                             5
Both small and great.;                                                                                                                       4
The Lord is faithful in his words.;                                                                                                          3
Their blood have they shed like water on every side of Jerusalem,;                                                                           5

From the rising up of the sun unto the going down thereof.;                                                                                  5
Well is thee and blessing to thy soul.;                                                                                                      4

He healeth those that are broken in heart, and cureth their pains.;                                                                          4
I will seek to do thee good.;                                                                                                                4
Glory be, etc.;                                                                                                                              1

Thou hast brought me down to the lowest pit;                                                                                                 4

From this time forth for evermore.;                                                                                                          5
For there is no salvation in his hand.;                                                                                                      4
And all my bones shall say.
They pass away, but thou abidest
Praise him with the voice and with crying.
Both small and great.
My lovers and my neighbours did stand looking upon my trouble.
The hope of all the ends of the earth.
Excellency and glory are before him.
And I sought him, but I found him not.
From this time forth for evermore.

The heavens are thine, the earth also is thine.;                                                                                             6
The Lord is faithful in his words.;                                                                                                          5
